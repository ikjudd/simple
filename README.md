# simple
Welcome! simple is an online listening platform built with the intention of creating a Spotify player stripped of its noisier UX / UI concepts, leaving the end-user with a music player that is stripped down and... yes ... simple.

Getting started...
1. Run **npm i** in /authServer and /client to install all necessary dependencies.
2. Open a terminal inside of your code editor and navigate to authServer/authorization_code - then run the following code inside your terminal..
    **node app.js**
    This will run the oAuth server necessary to access Spotify's API.
    
3. Open a second terminal in your code editor and navigate to /client - then run the following code inside your terminal..
    **npm start**
    This will run the simple interface.
