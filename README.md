# simple
simple is an online listening platform built with the intention of creating a Spotify player stripped of its noisier UX / UI concepts, leaving the end-user with a music player that is stripped down and... yes ... simple.

Getting started...  
1. Run **npm i** in /authServer and /client to install all necessary dependencies.  
2. Open a terminal inside of your code editor and navigate to authServer/authorization_code - then run the following code inside your terminal..  
    **node app.js**  
    This will run the oAuth server necessary to access Spotify's API.  
      
3. Open a second terminal in your code editor and navigate to /client - then run the following code inside your terminal..  
    **npm start**  
    This will run the simple interface.
