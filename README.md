# simple
My first solo project - an exploration of Spotify's API and oAuth.
I wanted to rebuild a version of Spotify with a stripped down view, allowing for a smooth user experience that cuts out a lot of the noise and goes straight to the music :)
Both /authorization_server and /client run on separate servers. Once you log into Spotify with your premium account credentials, you should be free to peruse the app all you'd like! Enjoy.
